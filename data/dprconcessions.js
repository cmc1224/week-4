           "description":"The Sheepfold in Central Park, constructed in the latter half of the 19th century at the same time as the Tweed Courthouse on Chambers Street (now home to the New York City Department of Education) is one of the City's finest examples of Victorian Gothic architecture and one of the Park's most treasured landmarked buildings. Presently a restaurant named Tavern on the Green, the building is the best surviving work of the British architect and ornamentalist, Jacob Wrey Mould (1825-1886).<BR><BR>\n\nMould is also responsible for other Park treasures including the carvings and the Minton tile arcade at Bethesda Terrace, the pavilions at Belvedere Castle, and many of the Park's ornamental bridges, designed in collaboration with Calvert Vaux. <BR><BR>\n\nConstructed of \"the best Colobaugh brick,\" local granite, and blue and gray Malden stone, the decorative elements of the building's facade are still intact despite twentieth century additions. The original U-shaped building had three elements: the Sheepfold proper (now the open air terrace and glassed-in Crystal Room); the residence of the Keeper and his men; and the open Loggie and their balconies. The northern and southern extremities of the building faced \"the Green,\" which became known, appropriately, as the Sheep Meadow. The present windows, flanked by red granite columns and decorative stone and tilework, may have once been part of the open air structure. The interior and possibly exterior flooring was originally paved with Minton encaustic tiles. Completing the compound, adjacent to the main building were barns and lofts for storage of feed for the sheep. <BR><BR>\n\nThe preliminary sketch for the building was published in the First Annual Report of the Department of Public Parks of 1871. Many construction drawings for the building are in the Municipal Archives of the City of New York. <BR><BR>\n\nParks Commissioner Robert Moses converted the Sheepfold (which actually housed 200 South Down sheep that grazed across the street) into a restaurant named Tavern on the Green, which opened to the public on October 20, 1934. New Yorkers quickly embraced this new eatery and it soon became an integral part of the City's social life. From the late 1930s until 1943, the restaurant was closed and the building was used as the headquarters for the Civilian Patrol Corps. The restaurant reopened in 1943 under new management and was renovated into a year-round facility. By the 1950s, the structure was showing some wear and tear and underwent a further renovation by the designer Raymond Loewy. At that time the restaurant had been expanded to serve more than 1,200 diners and the number of parking spaces was doubled. A succession of management companies operated the restaurant until well-known New York restaurateur Warner LeRoy acquired the license in 1973. The revitalized restaurant became a popular destination for tourists and New Yorkers alike.  <BR><BR>",

Designed as part of the 2012 Olympic Bid, the design allows for the walls running the length of the facility to potentially be removed for  expansion to a larger venue with a bleacher structure.  Like the construction of the Works Progress Administration era, simple materials are used to create this stunning architecture.  In this case, pre-cast concrete panels are punctuated with color glass tile to create the exterior and a three story glass lobby provides a dramatic introduction to the building.<BR><BR>\n\nThe World Ice Arena features a full-size, 17,000 square foot ice rink surface with ceiling heights between 40 and 60 feet.  The ice rink and pool complex is the largest recreational facility ever built in a New York City Park and serves as a year-round complex for competitive and recreational skaters.<BR><BR>\n\nThe World Ice Arena is open every day for Public Skating as well as a wide variety of ice skating activity. <BR><BR>\n\nMonday to Friday:<BR>\nPublic Skating begins at 9AM and ends at 5:20 PM <BR><BR>\n\nSaturday and Sunday:<BR>\nPublic Skating begins at 12 noon and ends at 4:50 PM<BR><BR>\n\nEvening Skating Sessions:<BR>\nFriday Evening session begins at 7PM and ends at 9:50 PM<BR>\nSaturday Evening session begins at 8PM and ends at 9:50 PM<BR>\n\nThe World Ice Arena is also home to the Catholic High School Hockey League, Flushing Speed Skating Club, the Ice Theatre of New York, NYC Women&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Hockey League, Sled Hockey of New York, Team Image Synchronized Skating Club, The World Ice Skating School, The World Ice Skate Shop, and the always popular, World Ice Caf&Atilde;&copy;.<BR><BR>\n\nWorld Ice is just a 10 minute walk from the Number 7 Line to CitiField, the USTA and Flushing Meadows Corona Park.  \n",
