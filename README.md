# Hungry Squirrels
 This map shows the locations of park concessions and locations of all "eating" squirrels, based on the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census.

According to NYC Open Data, The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/)
is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray
(Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public.
The complete dataset contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including
location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities,
communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.
