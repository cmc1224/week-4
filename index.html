            Do Hungry Squirrels eat at Parks Concessions Stands?

            According to NYC Open Data, The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/)
            is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray
            (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public.
            The complete dataset contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including
            location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities,
            communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

            This map depicts all squirrels who were "eating" when spotted, their primary fur color, and other activities at the time of
            spotting. Concessions stands are also displayed to see to if that's where the squirrels dine, too.
